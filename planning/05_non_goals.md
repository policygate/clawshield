# Non-Goals

ClawShield is NOT:

- A full security suite
- A vulnerability scanner
- A SIEM
- A cloud security platform
- A guarantee against exploitation
- A replacement for firewall or OS hardening
- A runtime sandbox

ClawShield does NOT:

- Execute unverified remote scripts
- Modify configurations without backup
- Transmit telemetry without explicit user consent
- Lock users into proprietary formats

ClawShield must remain lightweight and composable.
